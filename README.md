# vanilla_network
A practice in writing a rigidly structured fully connected neural network from scratch based upon the paper "Deep Learning: An Introduction for Applied Mathematicians" as published by SIAM

# Motivation
I began learning more about the mathematical background to and proofs of fundamental concepts within neural networks to gain a ground-up understanding. Using my coursework and published papers to guide my research into how to construct a neural network from scratch, I have developed a better ML theory skill set that using high-level APIs and frameworks cannot teach. This work is also motivated by my time at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where I was exposed to using tensorflow for CNN development.

The network of concern here takes in a pre-determined number of nuerons and layers to determine if a point on a two dimensional plane is an x or an o to help convey the idea of classification by means of a nueral network in a very simple case. 

# To Do
-~~Finish writing explanations of each code block and their mathematical motivations~~\
-Implement a way of inputting a random test vector and visualizing the network's placement of the set of points as either an x or an o\
-Clean up cost visualizations and run additional tests on batch losses versus single node loss calculation, among other tests TBD\
-Configure the network to begin attempting to solve systems of linear ODE's
