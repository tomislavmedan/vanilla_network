# vanilla_network
A practice in writing a rigidly structured fully connected neural network from scratch based upon the paper "Deep Learning: An Introduction for Applied Mathematicians" as published by SIAM

# Motivation
I began learning more about the mathematical background to and proofs of fundamental concepts within neural networks, and this [paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/18M1165748) helped guide my research into how to construct a neural network from scratch instead of using high-level API's like I have been using while doing basic machine learning work during my time with LBNL. 

The network of concern here takes in a pre-determined number of nuerons and layers to determine if a point on a two dimensional plane is an x or an o to help convey the idea of classification by means of a nueral network in a very simple case. 

# To Do
-Finish writing explanations of each code block and their mathematical motivations
-Implement a way of inputting a random test vector and visualizing the network's placement of the set of points as either an x or an o
-Clean up cost visualizations and run additional tests on batch losses versus single node loss calculation, among other tests TBD
